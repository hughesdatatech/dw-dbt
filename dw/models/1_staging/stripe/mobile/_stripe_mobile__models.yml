        data_type: varchar
        description: Possible values are incomplete, incomplete_expired,
          trialing, active, past_due, canceled, or unpaid.
          For collection_method=charge_automatically, a subscription moves into
          incomplete if the initial payment attempt fails. A subscription in
          this state can only have metadata and default_source updated. Once
          the first invoice is paid, the subscription moves into an active
          state. If the first invoice is not paid within 23 hours, the
          subscription transitions to incomplete_expired. This is a terminal
          state, the open invoice will be voided and no further invoices will
          be generated.
          A subscription that is currently in a trial period is trialing and
          moves to active when the trial period is over.
          If subscription collection_method=charge_automatically it becomes
          past_due when payment to renew it fails and canceled or unpaid
          (depending on your subscriptions settings) when Stripe has exhausted
          all payment retry attempts.
          If subscription collection_method=send_invoice it becomes past_due
          when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and canceled or unpaid
          if it is still not paid by an additional deadline after that.
          Note that when a subscription has a status of unpaid, no subsequent
          invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then
          immediately automatically closed). After receiving updated payment
          information from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay
          their closed invoices.
