    description: User-facing information mart where each record represents a unique member.
                Members are uniquely identifed by their member_hk which is a combination of 
                their id and the source system from which they came. This information mart
                only contains members who have passed all validation rules, i.e.
                no exceptions have been identifed.

    description: User-facing information mart where each record represents a unique member.
                This information mart is at the same level of granularity as im_member with
                the difference being that it only contains members who have NOT passed all
                validation rules, i.e. exceptions have been identifed.

    description: User-facing information mart where each record represents a unique member.
                This information mart is at the same level of granularity as im_member and
                im_member_exception. It is a view that combines data from both of those 
                information marts to provide the complete member data set, i.e.
                non-exceptional and exceptional records.
